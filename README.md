# 🔥 Real-Time Fire Detection System

A real-time fire detection application built using **YOLO**, **OpenCV**, and **Streamlit**, with an integrated audio alert system powered by **pygame**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Real-time fire detection via webcam using a custom YOLO model
- 🧠 Based on **Ultralytics YOLOv8**
- 🧯 Visual alert through annotated video stream
- 🔊 Audio alarm (`alarm.mp3`) plays when fire is detected
- 🧠 Intelligent logic prevents repeated alarm playback
- ✅ Streamlit-based clean user interface
